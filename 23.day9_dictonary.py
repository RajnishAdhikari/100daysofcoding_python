# Python dictonary 


# if we want to represent key value pairs as a single entity then 
# we should go for dictonary 
# Syntax
# {key : value, key: value}
# eg
# name: roll 
# domain : ip_address 

# Properties 
# 1.in dictonary value can be duplicate but key cannot be duplicate 
# 2. heterogenous object are allowed for both keys and values
# eg {'rajnish': 100 , 100 : 7.5}
# 3.Insertio order not preserve
# this means indexing and slicing isn't possible in dictonary
# 4.dictonary are mutable 
# this means we can make changes anywhere in dictonary
# 5. Dictonary are dynamic
# this means we make dictonary of any size we want 


# how to create dictonary
# empty dictonary 
# d = {}
# print( type(d))

# or 
# d = dict()   this is also an empty dictonary

# to insert value in empty dictonary 
# d[100] = "Hello"
# d[200] = "world"     # another way given below   
# d = {300: 'ram', 400: 'shyam'}
# print(d)


# ACCESSING THE ELEMENTS OF DICTONARY WITH ASSOCIATED KEY
d = {300: 'ram', 400: 'shyam',100:'AAAAAAAAA', 200:'BBBBBB'}
print(d)
