# For Loop 
# for item in list_of_items:
    #Do something to each item 

# fruits = ["apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
#if we want to access each item in this list then we will use forloop

# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)
#     print(fruit + " Pie")

# for loop program to implement average height exercise 
# student_heights = input("input a list of student heights :").split()
# for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
#     student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# print(f"The height of student is: {student_heights}")
# total_height = sum(student_heights)
# number_of_students = len(student_heights)
# average_height = round(total_height / number_of_students)
# print(f"the average height is : {average_height}")

# student_heights = input("input a list of student heights :").split()
# for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
#     student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# print(f"The height of student is: {student_heights}")
# total_height = 0
# for height in student_heights:
#     total_height = total_height + height
# print(total_height)
# number_of_students = 0
# for nos in student_heights:
#     number_of_students = number_of_students + 1
# print(number_of_students)

# print(f"The average height is : {average_height}")



# for loop always needs sequence here sequence means 
# list string dictonary, tuples,
# sequence is also called a collection of items 
  
# syntax:
# for x in sequence :   // sequence means it can be list, dictonary or any other items
#     body.......

# for eg:
# s = 'rajnishadhikari'
# for x in s:
#     print(x)

# same example to print character with index:
# s = 'rajnishadhikari'
# i = 0
# for x in s:
#     print(f"The character {x} is in index {i}")
#     i = i+1


# for x in range(10):
#     print(x)




# while loop:
# we use while loop until and unless the given condition is true

# SyntaxError
# while condition:
#     statement

# example:

# x = 1 
# while x<= 10:
#     print(x)
#     x = x+1

# name =''
# while name!='dhiraj':
#     name = input("Enter Name:")
# print("Thank You Sir")


# nested loop
